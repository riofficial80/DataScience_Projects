# 🚴 Bike Store Sales Dashboard using Tableau

## 📊 Project Overview

This project showcases a dynamic **Tableau dashboard** built around a **Bike Store relational dataset**. The dashboard provides interactive visualizations of key business metrics such as sales performance, product categories, customer demographics, and store locations. It aims to deliver actionable insights to stakeholders for better inventory management, sales strategies, and customer targeting.

Using Tableau’s powerful data blending, calculated fields, and visualization capabilities, the dashboard offers an engaging and intuitive user experience.

## 📁 Dataset Description

The Bike Store dataset includes multiple relational tables, such as:

- Customers (demographics and contact info)  
- Products (bikes, accessories, and components)  
- Item Orders (transaction details)  
- Stores (location)  
- Staffs (salespeople)  
- Orders (customer, status, and more)  
- Stocks (quantity of products in stores)  
- Brands (brand names)  
- Categories (category names)  
- Status (status of orders)  
  > **Note:** The Status table was added for this project and is not part of the original [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dillonmyrick/bike-store-sample-database).

The data requires appropriate joins and blending to produce meaningful insights.
