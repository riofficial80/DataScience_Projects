# 🚴 Bike Store Sales Dashboard using Power BI

## 📊 Project Overview

This project presents a dynamic **Power BI dashboard** built around a **Bike Store relational dataset**. The dashboard offers interactive visualizations of key business metrics such as sales performance, product categories, customer demographics, and store locations. It aims to provide actionable insights to stakeholders for enhanced inventory management, sales strategies, and customer targeting.

Leveraging Power BI’s data modeling, DAX calculations, and visualization capabilities, the dashboard delivers a rich, user-friendly experience.

## 📁 Dataset Description

The Bike Store dataset contains relational data from multiple tables, including:

- Customers (demographics and contact info)  
- Products (bikes, accessories, and components)  
- Item Orders (transaction details)  
- Stores (location)

  > **Note:** The Status table was added for this project and is not part of the original [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dillonmyrick/bike-store-sample-database).

The data is structured relationally, requiring careful relationship definitions and data modeling to generate meaningful insights.
